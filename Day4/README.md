# Day 4 Lab Sims

### Objective
Obtain noise margins from Vout vs Vin (VTC) curve of a CMOS inverter 

### Spice Netlist

| *Figure 1: Vout vs Vin of a CMOS inverter.* |

* As seen above, points at which the slope is apporximately 45/135 degrees are first extracted from the VTC curve. The noise margins are thus calculated as shown above.
